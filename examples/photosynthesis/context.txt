Photosynthesis is a biological process used by many cellular organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in organic compounds that can later be metabolized to provide cellular energy. Photosynthesis is vital for all aerobic life on Earth. In addition to maintaining normal levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, nearly all life either depends on it directly as a source of energy or indirectly as the ultimate source of the energy in their food. The rate of energy capture by photosynthesis is immense: approximately 130 terawatts, which is about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons of carbon into biomass per year.
