Photosynthesis is a biological process that converts light energy into chemical energy stored in organic compounds. It is vital for all aerobic life on Earth for two main reasons: First, it maintains normal levels of oxygen in the atmosphere, which is essential for aerobic organisms. Second, it serves as the primary energy source for nearly all life forms, either directly (for organisms that photosynthesize) or indirectly (as the ultimate source of energy in the food chain). The process captures approximately 130 terawatts of energy and converts around 100-115 billion tons of carbon into biomass annually.
